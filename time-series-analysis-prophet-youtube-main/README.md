# Time Series Analysis with Python Prophet
The Prophet library is an open source library designed to make predictions for univariate time series datasets. It is easy to use and by default is designed to automatically find a good set of hyperparameters for the model to make predictions for data with trends and seasonality.

You can access presentations and notebooks in the repo.

## Dataset
